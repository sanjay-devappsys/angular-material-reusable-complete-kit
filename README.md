# About Reusable Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


Well I wanted to write something lengthy but I don't have time

> Let's see I was working in a project the other day and saw an really outdated reusable componet  Built using Angular x Boostrap x (yup you guessed it) primeNG and Native styles, even tho the code and the way how the original developer implemented was a huge mess and hectic on it's own I liked the idea behind it, so decided to come up with my reusable for feature usage, xoxo,

 Arigato gosaimasu desu 


### Tech

Well nothing we are using  mean stack along with couple of other libs

* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
